### Obective

A sample kotest gradle application to demonstrate an issue with kotest-intellij-plugin.

#### Issue

I have `gradle` selected as runner for my tests. When I run the test file as a whole, then it is using gradle as expected

But when I run an individual spec it uses the kotest runner instead of gradle.
